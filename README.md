# AeroVision: British Airways Data Science Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of the **British Airways Data Science Job Simulation** offered via Forage.  
The goal was to step into the role of a **Data Scientist** and solve two real-world challenges:  
1. **Modeling Lounge Eligibility** at Heathrow Terminal 3 to support future capacity planning.  
2. **Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour** to help the marketing team target future holiday travelers.  

Through data modeling, machine learning, and visualization, the project provides actionable insights for **operational efficiency** and **customer acquisition strategy**.
